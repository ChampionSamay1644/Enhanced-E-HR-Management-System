# ENHANCED E-HR MANAGEMENT SYSTEM    


The Enhanced E-HR system is a user-friendly HR software made with Python. It helps manage HR tasks easily. It has secure login and different access levels for users. The design adjusts to different screen sizes. It stores data safely using Firebase. Different users have different functions, like admins, HR staff, bosses, and employees. They can access their specific tools after logging in. Admins can control user details centrally using Firebase.


## Features

We have 4 hierarchy in our project 
1. Admin
. Create & Remove HR logins
. Admin can login as HR/Manager/Employee

2. HR 
. Salary Management
. Employee Add/Remove
. Approve bonus/promotion/resignations
. Employee hours attended
. Survey/feedbacks/complaints checking

3. Manager 
. Performance review
. Approve vacation & resignations
. Apply for promotion of Employee
. Request for bonus

4. Employee
. Sick/Personal Leave
. Apply for vacation & resignations
. Submit Survey/feedbacks/complaints

So we have added all the features into our system and yu can use it accordingly.

## Roadmap

1.	Initialization: Login screen helps to identify if the user is Admin, HR, Boss or Employee.
2.	Database:  The user is then given the features with respect to its login details.
3.	Features: These are differentiated between Admin, HR, Boss and Employee respectively. 
4.	Admin: This user can remove or add login details of HR/Manager/Employee, sign in as per what permission level is desired and approve resignation.
5.	HR: This user can Add or remove manager/employee, manage salary and approve feedbacks, etc.
6.	Boss: This user can View performance, approve for vacation/sick leaves or resignations, bonus or promotions, etc.
7.	Employee: This user can check progress, apply for leaves, submit survey or apply for vacations, etc.

## Optimizations

We have used Python 3.12 with pil for better optimizations and tkinter to provide smooth functioning of interface to our system. Tkinter is been used to create widgets like buttons, combo box, tables, labels, etc.

We have used firebase for storing and accessing the database into our system.
## Tech Stack



To run our project you must install Python 3.12 and set the path to system and install modules like firebase_admin, tkinter and pillow in Python. You need initiate connection between firebase Server with our system to smoothly run and operate it.

## Appendix
The motivation behind the development of the Enhanced E-HR system stems from the growing need for organizations to optimize and modernize their human resource management processes. As businesses evolve in today's dynamic environment, efficient HR management becomes crucial for organizational success. Traditional manual methods are often time-consuming, prone to errors, and lack scalability. The Enhanced E-HR system aims to address these challenges by providing a comprehensive, user-friendly, and technologically advanced solution.
